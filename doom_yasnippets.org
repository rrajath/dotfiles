* Introduction
This config generates all the YASnippets for Doom Emacs in the following directory: =~/.doom.d/snippets/org-mode=
Each block generates a separate file. Tangling this file is same as others: =C-c C-c=, =C-c C-v t=

* Insert current time in org files
Just type ct and hit TAB. It will insert current time like [13:53]

#+begin_src text :tangle ~/.doom.d/snippets/org-mode/current_time
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: current_time
# key: ct
# --
`(format-time-string "[%H:%M]")`
#+end_src

* Insert journal date
Creating a journal entry in my journal.org is easy using a capture template. But sometimes, using my phone to fill up the journal entry would mean writing to refile.org instead of journal.org directly. This snippet helps with journal date entry

#+begin_src text :tangle ~/.doom.d/snippets/org-mode/journal_date
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: journal date
# key: ddd
# --
`(format-time-string "[%H:%M]")`

#+end_src

* Insert Journal Action Items
After each weekly review, this template makes it easier to add action items in my journal
#+begin_src text :tangle ~/.doom.d/snippets/org-mode/journal_action_items
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: journal action items
# key: jwa
# condition: t
# --
 *** --- `(format-time-string "W%W")` ---
AI:
#+end_src

* Insert Journal Weekly review

#+begin_src text :tangle ~/.doom.d/snippets/org-mode/journal_weekly_review
# -*- mode: snippet -*-
# name: weekly review
# key: jwr
# condition: t
# --
 *** Week `(format-time-string "(W%W)")` Review
 **** What went well this week?

 **** What didn't go well this week?

 **** What did you learn?
