#+STARTUP:    overview indent hidestars

* Introduction
This is the config for [[https://helix-editor.com][Helix Editor]]. It's a command line editor/IDE written in Rust that has syntax highlighting, tree sitter, LSP, multiple cursors support out of the box.
* Theme
I like monokai themes
#+begin_src shell
theme = "monokai_pro_octagon"
#+end_src
* Editor
** Basic Setup
Disable mouse mode, enable cursor line for better visibility on where the cursor is and set appropriate idle timeout for code completions to show up after right amount of delay.
#+begin_src shell
[editor]
mouse = false
color-modes = true
cursorline = true
idle-timeout = 150
#+end_src
** Cursor Shape
Change cursor shape based on different modes
#+begin_src shell
[editor.cursor-shape]
insert = "bar"
normal = "block"
select = "underline"
#+end_src
** File Picker
Ignore hidden files in file picker
#+begin_src shell
[editor.file-picker]
hidden = false
#+end_src
** Configure Statusline
Add things on the statusline at appropriate places.
#+begin_src shell
[editor.statusline]
left = ["mode", "spinner"]
center = ["file-name"]
right = ["diagnostics", "selections", "position", "file-encoding", "file-line-ending", "file-type"]
#+end_src
* Keybindings
** Normal mode keybindings
Some keybindings in normal mode so that it's easy to save and reload buffer.
#+begin_src shell
[keys.normal]
C-s = ":w"
C-r = ":reload"
esc = ["collapse_selection", "keep_primary_selection"]
#+end_src
