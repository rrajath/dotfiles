* Introduction
I haven't customized Sublime Text 3 a lot. So there's not much going on. I use couple of packages - PrettyJSON, maybe markdown, and that's about it.

* Setting color scheme, font size and window behavior

#+begin_src text :tangle "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings"
{
	"color_scheme": "Packages/Agila Theme/Agila Dracula.tmTheme",
	"font_size": 12,
	"ignored_packages":
	[
		"Markdown",
		"Vintage"
	],
	"open_files_in_new_window": false,
	"theme": "Agila.sublime-theme"
}

#+end_src

* Install the following packages

#+begin_src text :tangle "~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/Package Control.sublime-settings"
{
        "bootstrapped": true,
        "color_scheme": "Packages/Agila Theme/Agila Oceanic Next.tmTheme",
        "in_process_packages":
        [
        ],
        "installed_packages":
        [
                "Agila Theme",
                "MarkdownEditing",
                "Package Control",
                "Pretty JSON"
        ],
        "theme": "Agila.sublime-theme"
}

#+end_src
